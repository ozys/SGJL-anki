## SGJL-anki

An Anki clone of Nukemarine's "Suggested Guide to Japanese Literacy" Memrise courses, for those of us who prefer Anki.

I might have to split this repo up depending on how large it gets. This repo will stay here as the landing page if I ever do need to do that.


## Using this repo

Follow the instructions in each course's `README.md` file. In the general case, though, you will import all of the audio files into your anki data folder, make a new anki deck, and import the data into that deck. The format of those decks are up to you, but I make some suggesetions in each course.

For deck settings, I suggest using "Show new cards in order added", and unchecking the "Bury related new cards until the next day". This way, Anki will show you cards in an order that is closer to the Memrise order.

I'll also upload a finished `.apkg` file for each deck when I'm relatively confident that the course is "done".


## Credits

Huge credit goes to [Nukemarine](https://www.reddit.com/user/nukemarine) for compiling these SGJL courses on Memrise. The memrise user "Tucsonan" also made a few Memrise courses.

The content that was used in these courses comes mainly from:

 - "Remembering the Kana" by James Heisig
 - "Remembering the Kanji" by James Heisig
 - "2001.Kanji.Odyssey" by CosCom
 - "The Kodansha Kanji Learner's Course" by Andrew Scott Conning
 - "Tae Kim's Guide to Learning Japanese"
 - "A Dictionary of Basic/Intermediate/Advanced Japanese Grammar" by Seiichi Makino and Michio Tsutsui
 - The "Core 2k/6k/10k" wordlist by iKnow

## SGJL-anki Course List

Each section (Beginner, Intermediate, etc) is expected to require roughly 300-400 hours of dedicated study and review, totaling about 1500-2000 hours of study for the entire SGJL course.

Keep doing a course until you've at least *seen* every card in the course, then move on to the next course. Keep on reviewing whatever Anki tells you to review.

## Nukemarine's SGJL course posting (Memrise version)

[Here](./nukemarine-course-posting.md) is a copy of Nukemarine's typical [course posting](https://community.memrise.com/t/course-forum-suggested-guide-for-japanese-literacy-sgjl-course-series/1100) about the SGJL course on Memrise. I've edited the formatting slightly.
