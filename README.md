## SGJL-anki

An Anki clone of Nukemarine's "Suggested Guide to Japanese Literacy" memrise courses.

Huge credit goes to [Nukemarine](https://www.reddit.com/user/nukemarine) and contributors for their SGJL courses. I just like Anki way more than Memrise, so I made this repo. The only downside is that I won't get updates if the Memrise courses are updated, unless I re-scrape them, and you won't get updates from either Nukemarine or me if I update this repo. Oh well...

Also, I might have to split this repo up depending on how large it gets. This one will stay here as the landing page if I ever do need to do that.

## Using this repo

Follow the instructions in each course's `README.md` file. In the general case, though, you will import all of the audio files into your anki data folder, make a new anki deck, and import the data into that deck. The format of those decks are up to you, but I make some suggesetions in each course.

Yes, using anki instead of memrise will always be more work, but in return you get greater control of the format of the cards, the data, and the decks themselves.

## License

I have no idea what the legality of all this is; Nukemarine took a bunch of info from "Remembering the Hiragana/Katakana/Kanji", "Tae Kim's Japanese Grammar", "Core10k", and others -- and then I came along and took that.

It's probably safe to use for personal purposes, but redistribution *(like what I'm doing here...)* might be a little sketchy.

Below is a copy of Nukemarine's typical [course posting](https://community.memrise.com/t/course-forum-suggested-guide-for-japanese-literacy-sgjl-course-series/1100) about SGJL. I've taken some editorial license in formatting.

## Course Series

**SGJL Study Group** - [Click here to automatically join](http://www.memrise.com/group/1952641/)

Based upon [my original roadmap/guideline to Japanese fluency](http://forum.koohii.com/thread-5110.html) on the RevTK forums, the **Suggested Guide for Japanese Literacy** (SGJL) will be a 48 part series of courses plus supplemental immersion courses that gradually moves students from complete novice to advanced linguist. All courses will attempt to be based upon freely available resources when possible and include native level audio if available. Each major section (basic, intermediate, intermediate/advanced, advanced pt 1, advanced pt 2) is expected to require 300 to 400 hours each of dedicated study and review including immersion courses.

In each of the "levels", choose **one** of the options. *(you can probably choose more than one if you really want, but it might not help too much over just moving up one course number.)*

Nukemarine also suggests you do one [Japanese Drama Immersion course series](https://community.memrise.com/t/course-forum-japanese-drama-immersion-jdi-course-series/1756/3) between SGJL levels 5-6, 7-8, 10-11, and after 12. Maybe I'll add those to this repo later.


ADoBJG NOTE: For those that have A Dictionary of Basic Japanese Grammar these courses test using example sentences from those entries presented in Tae Kim order. The vocabulary and grammar is more complex even on the early entries. As such if you are starting out learning Japanese doing these courses at the end of the Basic Section is recommended. Others that are willing to handle the extra difficulty can do it alongside or in place of Tae Kim courses.
