## SGJL-anki

An Anki clone of Nukemarine's "Suggested Guide to Japanese Literacy" Memrise courses, for those of us who prefer Anki.

I might have to split this repo up depending on how large it gets. This repo will stay here as the landing page if I ever do need to do that.


## Using this repo

Follow the instructions in each course's `README.md` file. In the general case, though, you will import all of the audio files into your anki data folder, make a new anki deck, and import the data into that deck. The format of those decks are up to you, but I make some suggesetions in each course.

I'll also upload a finished `.apkg` file for each deck when I'm relatively confident that the course is "done".


## Credits

Huge credit goes to [Nukemarine](https://www.reddit.com/user/nukemarine) for compiling these SGJL courses on Memrise. The memrise user "Tucsonan" also made a few Memrise courses.

The content that was used in these courses comes mainly from:

 - "Remembering the Kana" by James Heisig
 - "Remembering the Kanji" by James Heisig
 - "2001.Kanji.Odyssey" by CosCom
 - "The Kodansha Kanji Learner's Course" by Andrew Scott Conning
 - "Tae Kim's Guide to Learning Japanese"
 - "A Dictionary of Basic/Intermediate/Advanced Japanese Grammar" by Seiichi Makino and Michio Tsutsui
 - The "Core 2k/6k/10k" wordlist by iKnow

## Nukemarine's SGJL course posting

[Here](nukemarine-course-posting.md) is a copy of Nukemarine's typical [course posting](https://community.memrise.com/t/course-forum-suggested-guide-for-japanese-literacy-sgjl-course-series/1100) about the SGJL course on Memrise. I've edited the formatting slightly.
