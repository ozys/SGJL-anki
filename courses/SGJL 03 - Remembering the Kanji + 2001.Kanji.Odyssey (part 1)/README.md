# SGJL 03 - Remembering the Kanji + 2001.Kanji.Odyssey (part 1)

### Course notes:

This course teaches the 555 commonly used Kanji that comprise 60% to 70% of everything written in Japanese. Remembering the Kanji (RTK) by James Heisig is a brilliant method of using mnemonics and stories to recognize and write Kanji from memory in your native language.

The primitive and story methods in RTK teaches the ability to recognize and write them from memory in your native language which you later use to help become literate in the Japanese language as it removes the excessive dependence on Romaji and Kana most foreign students of Japanese suffer. Together, this course offers an abbreviated RTK course of 555 characters instead of the full 2042 or more in Heisig's RTK book.

##### How to Use This Course

Take your time for each new Kanji. Use the book "Remembering the Kanji" 4th edition or above for stories or inspiration. For stories provided by other users, consider using the unofficial companion website [Reviewing the Kanji](http://kanji.koohii.com/index.php) or going to [this thread specifically]( http://forum.koohii.com/showthread.php?tid=2432) which a few years back collected a picture per kanji story. Considering writing down each new kanji two or three times the first time you create and visualize the story for the kanji in your head. In event of a mistake during testing, again considering writing the character down again. While it is possible to use the Japanese IME (input method editor) with typing to input the Kanji for testing, I recommend using the IME Pad and draw the character for the IME to find. It is slower, however this will test your production memory which is the most difficult to test.

### SGJL-anki notes

I couldn't scrape the information about the "Remembering The Kanji" notes/mnemonics from Memrise, so this SGJL course is relatively useless. You can still use it as a guide in your Kanji studies since these "Remembering The Kanji" courses sort the kanji by frequency, but it's still not really the best.

I'd say either skip this course for now and move on to SGJL 04, or use Memrise for this course.

Alternatively, I rather like WaniKani's teaching style for learning kanji. If you're serious about learning Japanese, I'd give that site a serious consideration.

Maybe I'll reformat these courses eventually to resemble WaniKani more.
